======================

Python Kata Calendrier républicain

Just a quick kata, converts the current date and time to date and time in the Calendrier républicain.

see: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendrier_r%C3%A9publicain

It has a lot of shortfalls and is by no way accurate since there are some special rules and the
calendar of the revolution has been abandoned long time.

It was fun to made, so have fun using it.
